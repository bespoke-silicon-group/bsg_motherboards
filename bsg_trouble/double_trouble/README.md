DoubleTrouble is a dual FPGA board, that allows you to emulate the RealTrouble FPGA board, which has an ASIC and Gateway FPGA, which was useful for debugging the I/O logic.

See [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbtDtNUZuRYwq27lyGmmfNojYJZf2jZowkG6wCDKnSc/edit) for the DoubleTrouble design document.

Two versions of the DoubleTrouble board were done. The first version used a 10-layer PCB and had some power integrity based limits on performance. The second version used a 14-layer PCB and optimized capacitor placement and had an improved stackup.
