### Overview ###

Guide for using the BSG board series.

### Organization ###

A sample directory structure or skeleton for bsg_designs is:

|-- double_trouble                        # ASIC emulation platform
|   `-- ...                               
|-- real_trouble                          # prototyping platform for BSX
|   `-- ...  
`-- super_trouble                         # prototyping platform for Celerity
    |
    |-- pcb_development                   # all pcb related file
    |   |
    |   |-- pcb_design                    # include schematic, layout and library
    |   |-- pcb_fabrication               # include stackup information, CAM files and docs related to fab
    |   `-- pcb_assembly                  # include BOM, component_map and scripts
    |   
    |-- firmware                          # all FPGA programs
    |   |
    |   |-- TODO_1: do we copy-n-paste the release version code here from bsg_fpga repo, or we put a Makefile here that automatically clone the bsg_fpga repo and checkout the correct version of code (I will create a new branch for release version code)?
    |   `-- TODO_2: in the future, do we allow other users to have access to our bsg_ip_cores, bsg_designs and other repos? If no, I will copy-n-paste all required files (of correct version) into this motherboard repo.

    |-- software                          # all host programs
