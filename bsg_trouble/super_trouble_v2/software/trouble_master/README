1) Purpose of the Tool
    This tool is the PC-end tool and user interface to control the DoubleTrouble board.
    It communicates with the board through a private protocol through UART.
    Refer to docs/trouble_master for the protocol.

2) Usage
    a. This tool requires pyserial. Install pyserial before running.
    b. In console_util.py, modify COM port definition to actual port
    c. Invoke trouble_master.py and run
        Read board version to test communication
        If the program crashes, use reset communication to reset FIFO
    d. Use magic number 45 as allow token to enable feature like voltage adjustment and power enable/disable

3) Basic Design
    This tool implements TroubleMaster protocol over UART.

4) Limitations
    This tool need to be modified to allow direct command line interaction.
