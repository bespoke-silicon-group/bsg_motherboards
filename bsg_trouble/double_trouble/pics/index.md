The Double Trouble Daughterboard has two Spartan-6 FPGAs, referred to as the "Gateway FPGA" and the "ASIC FPGA". The ASIC FPGA is replaced by your real ASIC chip in the "Real Trouble" Daughterboard.

The pictures contain two versions of the Double Trouble PCB.

Version 1.2 of the board is a 14-layer impedance-controlled board, designed with Mentorgraphics PADS.
It offers some tweaks for better power integrity (capacitors, 14-layers with better stackup and plane arrangement)
as well as optimized capacitor sizing and placement.

Version 1.0 of the board is 10-layer impedance-controlled board, designed with Mentorgraphics PADS.
