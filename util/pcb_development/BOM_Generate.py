BOM Generate.py

This script is called at the end of 'BOM Generate.BAS' which is a basic
script to run in PADS Layout. This script takes the CSV file outputted by
the basic script as well as the component map file and creates the final
formatted BOM file. In formatting the data, there are two main goals:

1) Take the BASIC script output (which describes each component individually)
and group them based on description. In theory, if the description matches then
they should be the same physical component (ex. both are 0402 100k ohm resistors).

2) Add the information from the component map file which includes the manufacturer
and vendor part number for every physical component.
